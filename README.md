We started this project by asking the question whether there is a way to get more accurate bus arrival time than real time information we got on OneBusAway. We knew that OneBusAway doesnâ€™t always provide the most accurate bus arrival time as it just provides real time information - it is not a prediction service. You might have the experience where OneBusAway says your bus is 2 minutes away, but after 2 minutes, it was 5 minutes delay. We originally want to see if we could make a more accurate estimation on bus arrival. Due to time constraints, we focused on whether bus delay is significantly different between different periods of time during the day. The results of our analysis are listed below: 
- There are longer delays during rush hours, 4.5 minutes at 8 am, and 5.5 minutes at 6 pm. 
- There is significant difference in delay between different times of a day. 
- Different Weather has significant difference in delay
- There is a pattern in average delay in minutes from day to day

Our initial data-scraping scripts and data are located outside of any folders. 

The Census Block, Zip Code, and D3 plots are located in the appropriately named folders. 

R plots and scritps are located in the R and figures folders.
